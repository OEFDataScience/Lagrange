# About REIGN

The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance (REIGN) dataset is the most robust leader-month data capturing national electoral process and leadership change. As of April 2019, it contains over 130,000 unique leader-month observations. 
REIGN, created by [Dr. Curtis Bell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WKi4SYIAAAAJ&hl=en), combines a number of publicly available academic datasets with original data collection. 

REIGN is updated at the beginning of each month and the newest data versions can be found in this repository. Alongside the data, you will also find a link to the most current REIGN blog updates
provided by One Earth Future Research. Click on the archive menu to access a list of links for past versions of REIGN. REIGN is 
updated during the last week of each month. For any questions concerning this website and the current status of updates, please contact current project manager
Clayton Besaw (<cbesaw@oneearthfuture.org>) 

OEFR Forecasting now hosts a medium blog called the Die is Forecast. This blog is dedicated to technical analyses and code vignettes regarding our REIGN data and CoupCast/ELVIS forecasting projects. Feel free to check it out 
[here](https://medium.com/the-die-is-forecast) if you interested in seeing how we use REIGN data to predict and understand the drivers of political violence and instability.

# Overview:

The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance (REIGN) dataset describes political conditions in every country each and every month. These conditions include the tenures and personal characteristics of world leaders, the types of political institutions and political regimes in effect, election outcomes and election announcements, and irregular events like coups, coup attempts and other violent conflicts. The dataset covers more than 200 countries for each month they were independent, January 1950 to the present. REIGN was created by gathering original data, compiling other datasets on political conditions, reviewing their coding rules, and updating all information to the present.

## Key Outputs:
* Political conditions in every sovereign state are updated monthly to the present. Coverage starts in January 1950.
* Includes information about more than 2,300 individual leaders in 201 different countries
* Provides new data about election announcements, delays, and outcomes
* Includes information about current conditions and scheduled future events, making it ideal for event forecasting.
