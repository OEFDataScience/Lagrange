**May 4th, 2020**
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA’s March 2020 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * Made changes to the inputs for gdp measures related to CoupCast/ELVIS forecasting pipeline. Usually we would update GDP figures using the IMF's World Economic Outlook release for April. However, COVID-19 has substantially disrupted IMF's normal process. As a result we have replaced the original IMF gdp input with gdp PPP in international dollars.

**April 1st, 2020**
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA’s February 2020 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).

  * Changed regime type for Hungary from parliamentary democracy to single-party authoritarianism. This coding change was conducted in light of a recent bill granting the ruling Fidesz party unlimited emergency powers without a timeline (https://www.ft.com/content/0029e6e2-7344-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca).

**March 6th, 2020**
  * Fixed coding error in which Paraguay's leadership change in 2018 was not accounted for. 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA’s December 2020 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * Removed Tawfiq-Allawi (Iraq) as a leader following the withdrawal of his nomination earlier this month.
  * Fixed miscoding of start date for James Marape in Papua New Guinea. This fixed a bug in which Marape's tenure as PNG leader was not captured in the data.
  * Fixed coding bug concerning Raul Casto. We had originally replaced Castro as leader with Diaz-Canel. However, we changed the coding back to Raul Castro after digging deeper into the Cuban political structure. When this occured, we failed to remove the exit date information for Raul Castro, effectively removing Cuba from the data for 2019/2020.

**February 12th, 2020**
  * Fixed a bug in which leaders who began their tenure in 2020 were not fully captured beyond January. The current REIGN dataset reflects this fix. 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA’s December 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * The methodology used for SPI projection beyond the NOAA measurements has changed since the last update. Previously, a single seasonal ARIMA model was used for every country. We now use an auto.arima function to fit the best model for each country during SPI forecasting.

**January 8th, 2020**
  * No technical updates beyond new leaders and elections this month. All other predictors are using most up-to-date information.

**December 2nd, 2019**
  * No technical updates beyond new leaders and elections this month. All other predictors are using most up-to-date information.
  * The REIGN team has changed how the current leader and elections lists are stored. They are now stored directly into the GitHub repository for easier automation access. The stored files will follow the same naming pattern (ex: leaderlist_"2digitmonth"_"last2digityear".csv)
  * Archived versions of the leaderlist, electionlist and REIGN are available by request from our organizational Dropbox.
  
**November 6th, 2019**
  * An acting PM for Tonga has been retroactively added to account for their leadership tenure before October's selection of a new PM.
  * Leadership in Cuba has been retroactively changed back to Raul Castro after examining the current leadership structure in Cuba. 
  * The coalition talks have been resolved in Belgium. Sophie Wilmès is now the first female prime minister in Belgian history.

  * Updated internal political violence indicator using newest UCDP Georeferenced Event Data release (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)
  * Updated regime type for Bolivia. Bolivia is now coded as a party-personalist government as of October 25th, 2019. This was a difficult decision and the REIGN team waited until after the election to come to a conclusion. Given the government's behavior in previous term-limit debates and solid evidence of electoral irregularities, we have changed Bolivia from a presidential democracy to a party-personalist system. 

**October 1st, 2019**
  * Fixed leader election dates and national election outcomes related to the following leadership-country periods: Guyana 1964;1968, Paraguay 1989, Belgium 1995, Luxembourg 1954, Andorra 1985, West Germany Kissinger;Schdmit, Czechlosovakia 1990, Greece 1958;1961, Bulgaria 1949;1953-1986, Estonia 2007;2015, Latvia 2006, Armenia Kocheryan, Azerbaijan 1993; Finland 1982, Norway Torp, Iceland 1959, Mali 1974, Benin 1991;1996;2001;2006;2016, Guinea 1968;1974;1990;2001, Seychelles 2006;2015-2016, Sudan 1958, Israel Bengurion;Sharrett, Turkmenistan 2007; Tajikistan 1991;1994, South Korea 1979;1980, Myanmar Unu;Ubaswe, Sri Lanka 1952, Cambodia 1976;1998, Australia 1966;1975, Tuvalu 2004;2010 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. (September Update: Looks like Belgium is in for a long caretaker period. If nothing changes, expect a PM change in December 2019 due to Michel's new commitments to the European Council). 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's August 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html). 
  * Updated regime type for Sudan. Sudan is now coded as a Civilian Provisional government as of August 2019. The REIGN team waited a month after the adoption of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan before making the decision. While the council will be headed by the military for the first 39 months of the transition, it lays the groundwork for civilian rule. 

**September 3rd, 2019**
  * Hotfix implemented to detect and correct "blank" country names in the first month of tenure for the following leaders: De Roburt (Nauru), Nakyama (Micronesia), Pashinyan (Armenia), da Costa (Sao Tome), Lini (Vanautu), Remeliik (Paulau). Hotfix will dynamically fix any problems with missing country names for future leaders. 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. (September Update: Looks like Belgium is in for a long caretaker period. If nothing changes, expect a PM change in December 2019 due to Michel's new commitments to the European Council). 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's July 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html). 
  
**July 30th, 2019**
  * Identified a number of leaders (DeRoburt, Da Costa, Nakyama, Lini, Remeliik, Pashinyan) who do not have country codings for the first month of their tenure. This is an unexpected bug in the leader panel creation process and is currently being worked on.
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. 
  
**July 2nd, 2019**
  * Identified a number of leaders (DeRoburt, Da Costa, Nakyama, Lini, Remeliik, Pashinyan) who do not have country codings for the first month of their tenure. This is an unexpected bug in the leader panel creation process and is currently being worked on.
  * Pavel Filip and Maia Sandu both switch head executive status twice during the month of June in the REIGN dataset. This isn't perfect, but it is difficult to code leadership shifts within a constitutional crisis. This coding may change based on future information. 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's May 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.precl.html).
  
**June 3rd, 2019**
  * Corrected leadership change for Australia to Morrison. This was not originally changed in August 2018. 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update.
  * Election outcome for Thailand currently unknown, so the result is uncoded as of this update. 
  * Finalized outcome data is coded for Andorra, Finland, and Indonesia.
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's April 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.precl.html).
  
**May 1st, 2019**
  * Fixed election outcome information for Estonia 2019 as coalition outcome was previously unclear. 
  * Preliminary outcome data is coded for Andorra, Finland, and Indonesia. These may change. 
  * Changed regime type for Sudan to military provisional.

  * Changed regime type for Egypt to military personalist. 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's March 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.precl.html).
  * Updated GDP and population data using the April 2019 IMF world economic outlook release (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/index.aspx).
  * Updated GDP using the newest World Bank release (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd).
  * Updated infant mortality rate data with newest World Bank release (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.imrt.in). Implemented country-specific ARIMA modeling for forecasting mortality rate for unreleased years. These numbers were previously produced using forward filling for unknown years. 
  * Added coup events in Sudan and Venezuela. 
  * Changed regime type for Turkey to party-personal hybrid (May 6th 2019) based on annulment of mayoral elections on May 6th.
