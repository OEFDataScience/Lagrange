**May 2020 REIGN Dataset: as of May 4th, 2020**

**New Leaders**
  * Alessandro Mancini (Social Democratic) and Grazia Zafferani (Environmental/Left-Wing) - San Marino
  * Bob Loughman (Democratic Socialist) - Vanuatu
  
**Key Elections**
  * Kiribati (final outcome currently unclear)
    
**Version Updates (As of May 4th, 2020)**
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAAâ€™s March 2020 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * Made changes to the inputs for gdp measures related to CoupCast/ELVIS forecasting pipeline. Usually we would update GDP figures using the IMF's World Economic Outlook release for April. However, COVID-19 has substantially disrupted IMF's normal process. As a result we have replaced the original IMF gdp input with gdp PPP in international dollars. 
  * Updated armed conflict data to reflect new peace-deals for 2020 and added previously uncoded conflicts for the following countries: Libya, Egypt, Ukraine, Cameroon, Iraq, Iran, United States, United Kingdom, Mali, Philippines, Central African Republic, Somalia, Afghanistan
  * Corrected leadership coding for Austria. Austria was coded as still having intermin Chancellor Bierlein as the chief executive. This has been changed to reflect Kurz's return to the position.
  * Added previously missed information about elections or election delays for the following countries: Guinea, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Dominican Republic
