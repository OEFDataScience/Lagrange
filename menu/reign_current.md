**February 2020 REIGN Dataset: February 3rd, 2020**

**New Leaders**
  * Spasovksi (Macedonia)
  * Sommaruga (Switzerland)
  * Kabua (Marshall Islands)
  * Haitham ibn Tariq (Oman)
  * Giammattei (Guatemala)

  
**Key Elections**

**Version Updates (As of February 12th, 2020)**
  * **February 12th**: Fixed a bug in which leaders who began their tenure in 2020 were not fully captured beyond January. The current REIGN dataset reflects this fix. 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAAâ€™s December 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * The methodology used for SPI projection beyond the NOAA measurements has changed since the last update. Previously, a single seasonal ARIMA model was used for every country. We now use an auto.arima function to fit the best model for each country during SPI forecasting.
