**September 2019 REIGN Dataset: September 3rd, 2019**

**New Leaders**
  * Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (Mauritania)
  * Lionel Aingimea (Nauru)
  
**Key Elections**
  * Guatemala
  * NAuru

    
**Version Updates (As of September 3rd, 2019)**
  * Hotfix implemented to detect and correct "blank" country names in the first month of tenure for the following leaders: De Roburt (Nauru), Nakyama (Micronesia), Pashinyan (Armenia), da Costa (Sao Tome), Lini (Vanautu), Remeliik (Paulau). Hotfix will dynamically fix any problems with missing country names for future leaders. 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. (September Update: Looks like Belgium is in for a long caretaker period. If nothing changes, expect a PM change in December 2019 due to Michel's new commitments to the European Council). 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's July 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
