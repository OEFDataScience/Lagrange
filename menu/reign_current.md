**Version Updates (As of October 2nd, 2019)**
  * The REIGN team identified a number of miscodings surrounding leader election dates and election event outcomes. Fixes were made over the month of September to reflect proper coding of the following country-leader periods. Guyana 1964-1968, Paraguay 1989, Belgium 1995, Luxembourg 1954, Andorra 1985, West Germany Kissinger;Schmidt, Czechoslovakia 1998, Greece 1958;1961, Bulgaria 1949;1953-1986, Estonia 2007;2015, Latvia 2006, Armenia Kocharyan, Azerbaijan 1993, Finland 1982, Norway Torp, Iceland 1959,  Mali 1974, Benin 1991;1996;2001;2006;2016, Guinea 1968;1974;1990;2001, Seychelles 2006;2015;2016, Sudan 1958, Israel Gengurion;Sharrett, Turkmenistan 2007, Tajikistan 1991;1994, South Korea 1979;1980, Myanmar Una;Ubaswe, Sri Lanka 1952, Cambodia 1976;1998, Australia 1966;1975, Tuvalu 2004;2010 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. (September Update: Looks like Belgium is in for a long caretaker period. If nothing changes, expect a PM change in December 2019 due to Michel's new commitments to the European Council). 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's August 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
  * Regime list has been updated to reflect one regime change. Sudan is now coded as a civilian provisional government starting in August 2019. The Sovereignty Council of Sudan will be headed by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan the military head of the Transitional Military Council for 21 months before handing the chair to a civilian. While al-Burhan is still a member of the military, it is clear that the new council both affords considerable power to civilian partners and paves the way for civilian government.
