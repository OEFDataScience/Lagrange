**November 2019 REIGN Dataset: November 6th, 2019**

**New Leaders**
  * Luca Boschi and Mariella Mularoni (San Marino - Changing of the Captains Regent)
  * Sophie Wilmès (Belgium)
  * Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa (Tonga)
  * Kais Saied (Tunisia)
  
**Key Elections**
  * Argentina
  * Bolivia
  * Botswana
  * Canada
  * Kosovo
  * Mozambique
  * Switzerland
  * Tunisia
  * Uruguay

    
**Version Updates (As of November 6th, 2019)**
  * An acting PM for Tonga has been retroactively added to account for their leadership tenure before October's selection of a new PM.
  * Leadership in Cuba has been retroactively changed back to Raul Castro after examining the current leadership structure in Cuba. 
  * The coalition talks have been resolved in Belgium. Sophie Wilmès is now the first female prime minister in Belgian history.
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's October 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html). 
  * Updated economic estimates with the IMF's October Global Economic Outlook release (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019).
  * Updated economic estimates with the World Bank's newest GDP data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd)
  * Updated infant mortality rate estimates with the World Bank's newest IMF data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN)
  * Updated internal political violence indicator using the newest Global Terrorism Database release (https://www.start.umd.edu/research-projects/global-terrorism-database-gtd)
  * Updated internal political violence indicator using newest UCDP Georeferenced Event Data release (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)
  * Updated regime type for Bolivia. Bolivia is now coded as a party-personalist government as of October 25th, 2019. This was a difficult decision and the REIGN team waited until after the election to come to a conclusion. Given the government's behavior in previous term-limit debates and solid evidence of electoral irregularities, we have changed Bolivia from a presidential democracy to a party-personalist system.

**September 2019 REIGN Dataset: September 3rd, 2019**

**New Leaders**
  * Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (Mauritania)
  * Lionel Aingimea (Nauru)
  
**Key Elections**
  * Guatemala
  * Nauru

    
**Version Updates (As of September 3rd, 2019)**
  * Hotfix implemented to detect and correct "blank" country names in the first month of tenure for the following leaders: De Roburt (Nauru), Nakyama (Micronesia), Pashinyan (Armenia), da Costa (Sao Tome), Lini (Vanautu), Remeliik (Paulau). Hotfix will dynamically fix any problems with missing country names for future leaders. 
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update. (September Update: Looks like Belgium is in for a long caretaker period. If nothing changes, expect a PM change in December 2019 due to Michel's new commitments to the European Council). 
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's July 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html).
