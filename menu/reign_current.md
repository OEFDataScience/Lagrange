**Version Updates (As of November 6th, 2019)**
  * An acting PM for Tonga has been retroactively added to account for their leadership tenure before October's selection of a new PM.
  * Leadership in Cuba has been retroactively changed back to Raul Castro after examining the current leadership structure in Cuba. 
  * The coalition talks have been resolved in Belgium. Sophie Wilmès is now the first female prime minister in Belgian history.
  * Updated precipitation (SPI) estimates using NOAA's October 2019 PREC/L release (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prel.html). 
  * Updated economic estimates with the IMF's October Global Economic Outlook release (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019).
  * Updated economic estimates with the World Bank's newest GDP data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd)
  * Updated infant mortality rate estimates with the World Bank's newest IMF data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN)
  * Updated internal political violence indicator using the newest Global Terrorism Database release (https://www.start.umd.edu/research-projects/global-terrorism-database-gtd)
  * Updated internal political violence indicator using newest UCDP Georeferenced Event Data release (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)
  * Updated regime type for Bolivia. Bolivia is now coded as a party-personalist government as of October 25th, 2019. This was a difficult decision and the REIGN team waited until after the election to come to a conclusion. Given the government's behavior in previous term-limit debates and solid evidence of electoral irregularities, we have changed Bolivia from a presidential democracy to a party-personalist system.
