  * Mohamed Ennaceur (Tunisia)

**Version Updates (As of July 30th, 2019)**
  * Identified a number of leaders (DeRoburt, Da Costa, Nakyama, Lini, Remeliik, Pashinyan) who do not have country codings for the first month of their tenure. This is an unexpected bug in the leader panel creation process and is currently being worked on.
  * Coalition outcome for Belgian general election is expected to take time, so the result is uncoded as of this update.
